        <h1>The media can play a significant role in raising awareness, dispelling myths and exposing misleading information about the COVID-19 pandemic. </h1>
        <p>This is a time when the whole country is working towards fighting the coronavirus pandemic and various sections of the population are finding it extremely hard to cope up with the economic stress.  Many people have lost their livelihoods and sources of income, companies have laid off people in large numbers and many working in the unorganised sector are at an unprecedented loss. Media organisations too have not been exempted from this crisis and are laying off and cutting the salaries of a large number of employees. Several media organisations have gone ahead and cut down the salaries of their employees and even asked many people to leave in recent weeks following the harsh impactions of the lockdown on the Indian economy.
The National Alliance of Journalists(NAJ) and Delhi Union of Journalists(DUJ)have accused many media owners of using this phase of the nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus as an “excuse for retrenchment and arbitrary pay cuts.”

<p>In a statement that had been issued by the organisation, they said that the novel coronavirus was a “national crisis and the pain of dealing with this crisis must be accepted by the media companies and their shareholders, not passed on to vulnerable employees.”
Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, on Wednesday demanded that journalists, photographers and camerapersons be accorded as “frontline workers” in the fight against COVID-19 and they be vaccinated on a priority basis.</p>

        In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Mr. Fadnavis said at least 12 States had included journalists and camerapersons in the frontline workers category and had got them vaccinated.

“A number of States, including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab and West Bengal among others, have recognised media persons as ‘frontline workers’ for their respective COVID-19 vaccination drives. Unfortunately, the decision is still pending in Maharashtra,” Mr. Fadnavis said, adding that several journalists and mediapersons had succumbed to the virus in the first and second wave of the pandemic.

He said the demands of the vocation compelled journalists to visit hospitals, crematoriums and other high-risk locations in order to highlight the problems faced by the public during the pandemic, besides sensitising the public to adhere to COVID-19 norms.
