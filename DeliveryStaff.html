        <h1>Delivery Staff Helped In Covid Pandamic.</h1>
        <p>As delivery boys run pillar to post delivering goods including clothes, groceries, etc they share their experiences of at times having to compromise on their dignity. Even before the pandemic struck, it wasn’t an easy life for these delivery boys. But now, since there is an increased stigma attached to those who turn Covid-19 positive, attitudes of people have changed drastically, and more so towards the delivery boys who are mostly outdoors, working amid the Covid-19 crisis, to ensure that we all get whatever essentials and luxury items we order from the comfort of our homes.</p>

        <p>Those who bring food, groceries, medicines and other supplies to our doorstep share how the work stress has increased amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
As the pandemic rages around us and lockdowns are imposed, these men and women are proving to be a lifeline across Indian cities. Shouldering outsized bags and driving around town, they reach us with food, medicines, groceries and more with clockwork precision, bar a few hiccups here and there. They are the delivery agents with various app-based services and websites.</p>
        <h1>Trained in COVID protocols, onus of safety on delivery agents</h1>
        <p>“Our company asks us to wear masks and follow protocols while delivering, but the onus is mostly on the delivery person. We had awareness sessions on COVID-19. Also, there is a doctor’s consultation facility on our delivery partner app,” says Roshan, a delivery agent from Bengaluru. Paresh, a delivery agent from Delhi, says that multiple temperature checks happen throughout the day at restaurants. “We receive COVID training as notifications on our phones by aggregators and we have to upload selfies to show that we are in uniform and wearing a mask,” he adds.</p>

        <p>As COVID-19 numbers soar, gas delivery boys have begun depositing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder refills at the door steps of customers. Officials at Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) said that they had asked their distributors to restart this practice, which had been introduced last year during the lockdown. “Unless the customer expressly asks that the cylinder be kept inside the house, the delivery personnel have to make the pre-delivery checks, including weighing, checking pin and O-ring, outside the premises,” said an official of IOCL.</p>

        <p>An official at Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. said the boys were continuing last year’s practice when it came to deliveries. “We are ensuring mask compliance. Distributors are giving boiled eggs, kabasura kudineer and even zinc and iron tablets to the delivery boys,” he said.</p>
<p>A distributor, however, said that they were unable to provide vaccination to the delivery personnel despite being frontline warriors. “Each man visits at least 30 homes daily. We are worried about the safety of both our staff and the customers. So far, the oil companies and the government have not taken any steps to ensure these men are vaccinated, which is very unfortunate,” he said.</p>
